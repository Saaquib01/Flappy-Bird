## Flappy Bird 

This is a clone of the popular mobile game Flappy Bird, created using the Pygame library in Python.

The objective of the game is to guide a bird through a series of pipes by tapping the screen (or pressing the spacebar) to flap its wings and gain altitude. The bird's altitude decreases over time, so the player must time their flaps carefully to avoid crashing into the pipes.

The game features simple graphics and sound effects, and includes a score counter that keeps track of the player's progress. The game also has a game over screen that appears when the player collides with a pipe or touches the ground.

To run the game, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer, as well as the Pygame library. Once you have these dependencies installed, simply run the flappy_bird.py file to start the game.

Feel free to modify the game's code or assets to create your own version of Flappy Bird, and have fun!
